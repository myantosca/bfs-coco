    \paragraph{}{
      The graph representations available from the SNAP database\autocite{SNAP} are in a textual format
      over which is difficult to efficiently parallelize data access. Whereas one could serially access
      the data from a predetermined root node and thereafter distribute it to other participating nodes,
      the loading time might be reduced if all the nodes could participate in the loading by each focusing
      on a subset of the data to be loaded. At rest, the vertex-centric model has a disadvantage against
      the edge-centric model since the variability of node composition in the absence of a guarantee of
      isomorphism or regularity necessitates additional header information on top of the unevenness of
      distribution. The optimal distribution of data cannot be determined \emph{a priori} by an unbiased
      strategy.
    }
    \paragraph{}{
      Conversely, the read load of an edge-centric model can be evenly distributed when
      encoded in an efficient packed binary format since all edges are symmetric with each
      other provided that the vertex labels can be expressed in a fixed-width format. It is
      likely for this reason that the SNAP database provides models as a set of edges. A
      little preprocessing work up front could yield dividends, even when the algorithm
      model is vertex-centric. To this end, the \texttt{txt2mpig} utility was created with
      the additional benefit of a decrease in storage costs at rest since each node label
      only requires 4 bytes (each edge 8 bytes).

      The same binary file format could easily be generated in a stream-processing fashion
      for an Erdos-Renyi probabilistic graph. Two variants of the algorithm were created,
      largely out of a necessity to find a more time-efficient graph generator.
      Unfortunately, as the names suggest, the latter algorithm sacrificed some
      correctness for the sake of speed.

      the overhead necessary to generate a combinatorial set of coin flips.
      However, the use of the uniform distribution to choose an $O(np)$ sequence
      of numbers runs the risk of sampling duplicate edges. Even when $p = 1$,
      the algorithm did not always generate a complete graph. A simple shuffle
      algorithm would be a better choice if not for the onerous \emph{space}
      requirements at the data scales under consideration.

\section{Results}{
  \subsection{Test Procedures}{
    \paragraph{}{
      Tests to validate correctness were performed locally on a dual-core laptop
      \footnote{2 x Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-6200U CPU @ 2.30GHz.} running Pop!OS.
      \footnote{An Ubuntu 18.04 variant.}
      Tests for which results were collected systematically and graphed were
      done on the UH \texttt{crill} cluster with the following parameters:
      \begin{itemize}
      \item{$n \in 2^{[10,20]}$, the total population size}
      \item{$k \in \{1,2,4,8,16,32\}$, the number of distributed nodes}
      \item{$\epsilon = 0.2$, the threshold error}
      \item{$p$, the existential probability of a given edge,
        \begin{align}
          p &
          \begin{cases}
            < \frac{(1 - \epsilon)\ln n}{n} \\
            = \frac{\ln n}{n} \\
            > \frac{(1 + \epsilon)\ln n}{n} \\
            < \frac{(1 - \epsilon)}{n} \\
            = \frac{1}{n} \\
            > \frac{(1 + \epsilon)}{n} \\
          \end{cases}
        \end{align}
      }
      \end{itemize}
      Each parameter combination was executed on 3 pre-generated graphs
      per regime. The graphs generated with the naive combinatorial edge
      selection scheme only covered graphs with $n \leq 2^{17}$ because of
      the immense time required for generation. However, this should still
      provide enough data points to observe a general trend and make cogent
      comparisons with the much faster but slightly incorrect binomial edge
      selection scheme.
